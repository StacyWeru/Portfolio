                                <p>This is an animal that I grately admire and if I were to be presumptious I would call it my spirit animal .</p>
                                <p><span>The wolf is known for being passionate ,graceful ,generous and deeply emotional. The wolf is also very independent and can spend much of their lives alone, quite happily. But they are a pack breed and will eventually want to be a part of a group, family, or community.</span></p> </div>
                                 <div class="items">
                                <p>At their worst, the wolf can become obsessive over friends or family members, impractical, and even vindictive. But in the right environment, they are incredibly nurturing, gentle, and very affectionate.</p> 
                                <p>Their ultimate goal in life is to not only find true love, but to nurture it for a lifetime. Thus the concept of having soulmates was born and honestly I find that very appealing.</p></div>

                  <h4>About Me</h4>
                       <p>Hello,My name is Stacy Wanjiku Weru.I am currently a student of <em>Moringa School</em>.I am also a student at Yangtze University in Hubei Province,China studying Civil Engineering , but due to the current Covid-19 pandemic there has been very many restrictions,air travel included,therefore going back to school is a no-go in the foreseeable future.<br> I am the first born girl child in a family of five;Two healthy parents,one younger sister and one younger brother.I am very proud of them .</p>

                      <h4>Why am I here</h4>
                         <p>The reason as to why I am here in this school is that I decided to pursue programming to get an actual certificate because in this day and time ,everything is online,meaning that hopefully that there will actuall be more jobs offered and to be pursued in the future.I realise that this might not be easy but if it were everyone would be a genious at programming and there would be no need to study anymore cause everything would be hacked into(Remind me to remove this later cause its just random rumbling).From research done this is going to be a really competitive field in the future if it is not already therefore I shall join in as soon as I can which is now.</p>

            <h4>Hobbies and interests</h4>
                  <p>I personally think that hobbies and interests tend to evolve or die about with the passage of time or with the situation around you.But during this period of quarantine, finding either a new hobby or interest is quite difficult because of the lack of inspiration so somedays become a repaet of the previous day.But we make due so as to not go expire to early.Reminds me of a song lyric that says;"<em>You gotta go insane to stay sane</em>" </p>
        
        <p>Some of my current hobbies include:</p>
