             <p>This is an animal that I grately admire and if I were to be presumptious I would call it my spirit animal.The wolf is known for being passionate ,graceful ,generous and deeply emotional. The wolf is also very independent and can spend much of their lives alone, quite happily. But they are a pack breed and will eventually want to be a part of a group, family, or community. At their worst, the wolf can become obsessive over friends or family members, impractical, and even vindictive. But in the right environment, they are incredibly nurturing, gentle, and very affectionate. Their ultimate goal in life is to not only find true love, but to nurture it for a lifetime. Thus the concept of having soulmates was born and honestly I find that very appealing.</p></div>
